            <h1>About Me!</h1><hr>
          <p> Hi my name is Caden Weaver and this is a introduction website I am making for the DS4200 class! I am from Santa Barbara, California
          and am a 2nd year at Northeastern University in Boston. I am majoring in Data Science. In my spare time I like to play video games,
          volleyball, soccer, and many other things. I have 2 sisters and 1 brother. I went to Laguna Blanca School in CA where I found I was very interested in
          programming, data analysis, and other STEM things. After I enrolled in Northeastern University I found myself gravitating more towards data science and
          data analysis. I enjoy the simplicity that python notebooks offer and find it very soothing and even fun to catagorize and clean big datasets. It is super
          satisfying to spend a bunch of time cleaning and working on a dataset and to finally produce a meaningful visualization! Is this all true about myself?
          Am I just trying to hit the 200 word count? What interesting questions! I realized half-way through this that I am really boring and that there is nothing for me to
          write about myself! I will strive to live a more fruitful and exasperating life in the future that will quantify into more than 200 words! Until then, I will keep
          stalling to hit the word counts! If you're an employer: please hire me! I have another portfolio <a href="https://weacad.github.io/portfolio/">here</a>. </p>
