          <p>
            Santa barbara is a town in Southern California which I lived in since 5th grade. It has lush greenary, pristine beaches, and nice sights. My favorite parts are
            probably the sunrises/sunsets where the sky glows vibrant hues of red, orange, or yellow. One of my favorite parts of Santa Barbara is how the temperature is very well
            regulated. There are rarely days where the temperature goes below 60 or above 80, which means you can be comfortable living year round. Even though I do not surf, I
            can still appreciate the scenery and ocean. I have spent many days at the beaches with friends or family, doing hikes on the nearby mountains/hills, or enjoying views
            from various parks or other spots. However, there are some major drawbacks. Certain places in Santa Barbara are super expensive, and gas prices can go incredibly high.
            There is also the issue that the closest major airport is in LA so I need to drive through traffic to fly most places. However, to get to Boston I usually take a flight
            from Santa Barbara through Phoenix to Boston. Overall, Santa Barbara is a wonderful place and I recommend everyone try visiting if they get the opportunity.
